# Solidity programming

This is a learning repo. It aims to develope basic, yet useful, (d)Apps in the Etherum ecosystem. This repo was inspired from Etherum 101 and Etherum 102 from Ivan on Tech Academy. 

### 1. Multi-signature
- contracts that explore data storage efficiency 
- multi-signature transaction validation is straightforward in an accounting model Blockchain
- need to leverage efficiency strategies when appending new elements to the ledger
- avoid looping over lists to find tail elements

## 2. ERC20 
- re-implementing toy cryto-kitties NFTs
- also in this directory:
    small indepependent contracts:
        - Ethereum data storage and its cost relationship
        - Efficient ways of storing client data in the acounting model
        - Begginer setup with Truffle and Open Zeppelin
